## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
   This model assumes that the number of people per row is constant.
   X = t0 + t1+ n*t2 + n*t3
	where   t0 is the overall starting time,
		t1 is the time needed to count one row
		t2 is the time needed to gather a number from a row
		t3 is the time needed to add a number
		n is the number of rows
2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
   X’ = t0 + n*t1

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
   X’ > X => n > t1/(t1-t2-t3)
